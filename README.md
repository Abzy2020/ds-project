Contributions:
*We each reviewed each of the files but we are basing this off of what we spent the most time on. The whole project was done through meeting dates. Each member had a say on each datastructure implementation and the overal format of the project. 
*We had each member spend time debugging and testing the code for each of the files to make sure that they were working properly.
*Using various github extensions we were able to actively work on the project at the same time as well as using live view features to collaborate when stuck.
*Overall the project was completed in an organized manner and we had no issues meeting and collaborating we hope you enjoy our project.
